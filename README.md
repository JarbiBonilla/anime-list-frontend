Welcome to My Anime List! Where you can keep track of all your current favorite animes and well as your favorite characters!

## Installation

To get this game up and running, you'll need to fork and clone this repo, along with the [anime-list-backend](https://github.com/JarbiBonilla/anime-list-backend).

You'll need to have SQLite and Rails installed.
* Run your SQLite server for the DB.
* Run the rails server from the anime-list-backend.
* Once the Rails server is running, you can open the front end by running ``npx reload -b`` in the terminal [from the frontend](https://github.com/JarbiBonilla/anime-list-frontend) , on your browser.

You'll need to cd into the project directory and run ``bundle install``. All the gem dependancies will then be installed.

* rails db:create
